debathena-mitmailutils (10.1.3-0debathena1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Have mailquota tell you what quota it's displaying, so that the mailquota
    output from dotfiles makes more sense.

debathena-mitmailutils (10.1.2-0debathena1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Switch from Hesiod to using *.mail.mit.edu so we can use GSSAPI
    authentication (Trac: #403).
  * Because of a Cyrus SASL bug (documented in that ticket) regarding
    parsing long encrypted responses, set maxssf to zero to send mail in
    the clear. This isn't as terrible as it sounds because mail travels
    in the clear on the public Internet anyway, and a bunch of client
    programs (Pine on Athena 9, for instance) don't use encryption, and
    the major use of mitmailutils is `from` and `mailquota` anyway.

    Patch based on one from Jonathan Reed <jdreed@mit.edu>.

debathena-mitmailutils (10.1.0-0debathena3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't run mitmailutils on EXCHANGE.MIT.EDU accounts for now, since this
    will hang forever (since IMAP.EXCHANGE, not EXCHANGE, is the IMAP server,
    but it doesn't currently support GSSAPI anyway).

debathena-mitmailutils (10.1.0-0debathena2) unstable; urgency=low

    packages to make the upgrade path smoother.

debathena-mitmailutils (10.1.0-0debathena1) unstable; urgency=low
